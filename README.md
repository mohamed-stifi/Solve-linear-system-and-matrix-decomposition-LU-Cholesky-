Linear Algebra Solvers and Matrix Decompositions
This repository contains Python implementations for solving systems of linear equations, finding the inverse of a matrix, and performing matrix decompositions. The following methods are included:

Gauss-Jordan Elimination: Solves a system of linear equations A x = b and finds the inverse of a matrix A using the Gauss-Jordan elimination method.

LU Decomposition: Computes the LU decomposition of a matrix A and uses it to solve the system A x = b.

Cholesky Decomposition: Performs the Cholesky decomposition of a positive-definite matrix A and uses it to solve the system A x = b.

Comparison: Computes the running time of these solving methods and provides a comparison of their efficiency.
